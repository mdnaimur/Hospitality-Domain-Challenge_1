# AtliQ Hospitality Data Analysis for Revenue Team

**Problem Statement**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Suggestion:**

- Prices should be adjusted based on the city, such as modifying hotel prices in Bangalore and Hyderabad.
- Total capacity should be adjusted according to demand. In this case, Delhi and Hyderabad have a total capacity higher than the demand.
- Offering discounts on bookings made during the last month can help reduce cancellations.
- Enhancements such as improving decorations, increasing facilities, and implementing marketing strategies can also be beneficial.
